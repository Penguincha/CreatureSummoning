Level: 4
School: Illusion

Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell is similar to the Invisibility spell, but the recipient is able to attack, either by missile discharge, melee combat, or spellcasting, and remain unseen. Note, however, that there are sometimes telltale traces, a shimmering, that enable observant opponents to approximate the invisible characterâ€™s whereabouts. These traces are only noticeable when specifically looked for, after the creature has made his presence known. Once the character has revealed himself, opponents can attempt to attack him with conventional weapons, though they do so with a -4 penalty to the attack roll, or they may cast area of effect spells near his position. Opponents remain unable to directly target the invisible creature with spells, scrolls, or abilities until the spell duration expires or the invisibility is dispelled.~
