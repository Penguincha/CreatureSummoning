# CreatureSummoning

*INTRODUCTION*

I always had a heavy love for summoner characters, especially horde summons like Vaal Summon Skeletons from Path of Exile.

I wanted to make a summoning mod with horde based mechanics, as well as randomness, so I figured why not just make a reworked Monster Summoning Mod?

This mod uses a base-work reference with Spell-Revision's Monster Summoning, and adds an option in the third level spell and above to summon more of monsters ala BG1 Monster Summoning that are 2-HD lower, as well as making them circumvent the summon limit.

NOTE: IT IS HEAVILY RECOMMENDED THAT YOU INSTALL EEEX (https://github.com/Bubb13/EEex/archive/master.zip), AS THE GAME WILL CRASH IF YOU TRY TO MAKE A MULTI-CLASSED MAGE.



*COMPONENTS*


1. Animations and Sounds

1a. Add Animations

This adds all the neccessary sprites and INI files for the creature to use, as well as implementing SOD's ANIMATE.IDS. Install unless you already have an animation megamod.

1b. Add Sounds

This mod adds all the sounds that the creatures use. Install


2. Install Creature Summoning

2a. Just Monsters
2b. Monsters and Basic Races

The component includes wizard spells for Levels 1-9, as well as one high-level ability. These are separate from the vanilla/Spell Revisions Monster Summoning.

The basic races include all the selectable races (excluding half-elf) in the summoning table, as well as some other humanoids in the higher levels.

All of the creature's stats can be found in the folder Creature Documentation, or the in-game description of the spells.


3. Store Alterations

This adds scrolls to the following shops:

Note: EET will add all of the shops from BGEE, SOD and BG2EE

BGEE: High Hedge, Sorcerous Sundries, Dinguer the Mad (Black Pits)
SOD: Belegram's Wands, Potions and Scrolls
BG2EE: Galoomp the Bookkeeper, Lady Yuth (Diedre with Item Revisions), Red Wizard Scroll Merchant, Ust Natha Scroll Merchant, Ribald's Special Stock, Lazarus Librarus, Book Merchant (both Neera's quest and Black Pits 2)
IWDEE: Orrick the Grey, Nym, Keiran Nye, Edion Caradoc
